📌 Problem Statement — H-002 | Hyper-Personalized Customer Experience Automation

Modern retail customers expect instant, precise, and context-aware support — whether they are checking stock, asking for nearby store recommendations, tracking orders, or seeking personalized offers.
However, traditional chatbots consistently fail in real-world customer experience scenarios because:

❌ They provide generic one-size-fits-all replies

Instead of using customer history, loyalty data, or context, legacy chatbots return vague responses.

❌ They do not understand vague human expressions

Example:

User: “I’m cold.”
A generic bot fails, but a real AI assistant should interpret intent.

❌ They lack location and real-time context awareness

Customers expect agents to know:

nearest store

ongoing offers

stock availability

personalized coupons

❌ They cannot retrieve or reason over internal business documents

Policies, store data, loyalty program rules, PDFs, internal FAQs — none are used by traditional chatbots.

❌ They risk exposing sensitive customer information

Many fail to properly mask personally identifiable information (PII) like phone numbers, emails, or order IDs.
